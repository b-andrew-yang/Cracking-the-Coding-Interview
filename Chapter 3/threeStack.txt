To design three stacks using a single array
	Split the array into three sections
	Have a separator at the end each of the sections such as -1
		This separator denotes the different sections.
	Have three indices remembering where the separators are.
	When pushing onto the stack add to the respective (indices - 1)
	When popping or pushing we shift all of the units over left or right accordingly.
