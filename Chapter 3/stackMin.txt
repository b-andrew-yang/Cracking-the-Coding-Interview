Stack Min:
	How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element?
	Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

	Solution: 
		I would create the stack using a linked list with the head being the last element of the list.
		Then I would create two variables,
			One that keeps track of the index of the last element (head),
				(Could also just use LinkedList.size()-1 here)
			Another that keeps track of the index of the min element
		Push could be implemented in O(1) time by just adding the element to the back of the linked list.
		Pop would also be implemented in O(1) time by copying the last element, removing it, and returning the copy.
			I would also update the last index by subtracting one.
		Min would be implemented by removing the element at the index of the min element using LinkedList.get(minIndex).
			The last index would be updated by subtracting one.
